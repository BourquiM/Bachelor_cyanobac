units:

nutrients (NH4_N,PO4_P,NO3_N) are in mg/L
temperature is in Celsius

phyto and microzooplankton abundances are in indviduals per L
zooplankton abundances are in individuals per m2 (when originally given in indv/m3 we multiplied the abundance by the sampling depth)

ID_CH can be converted into taxonomic classification using meta DB's (found here: )

all variables are averaged over the water column (meta lake data can be found here: )

temp_chem (discrete samples, average over all dephts)
large_zoo BAL and SEM (continuous samples, sum over dephts (n=2) and id_CH. Then divided all values by 2; this accounts for indv. that are found only at one depth.) Check this!! Because if they are in /m3 we have to multiply by depth to calculate the /m2 (i.e. transform indv./L into grams per m2: quantity * biovolume * depth * 10^-9, so to transform indv/m3 into indv/m2 we have to do indv/m3*depth)				

large_zoo ZHR is already in m2 with two levels, below 20 and above 20. To get the zooplankton over the water column we summed them and divided by 2

Problems:

High value in GRE for temperature on 2003-06-16 (maybe remove?) 17.47°C over the water column --> no measures after 12.5 m. Exclude!
High value in GRE for temperature on 2009-08-10 (maybe remove?) 16.80°C over the water column --> no measures after 12.5 m. Exclude!
